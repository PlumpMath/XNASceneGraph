# XNASceneGraph

Personal project about an optimized high-level 3D scene graph library using the XNA Framework and C# (All scene graph code is in CombatDevelopersEngine directory, and the entry point is SampleGame/Game.cs)
 
Implemented a camera system and parent-children transformations hierarchy from scratch.
 
Using this library, you can easily translate, rotate or scale a node with respect to a point, without having to worry about low-level code. Also, you can quickly set the camera perspective, position and "lookAt".
