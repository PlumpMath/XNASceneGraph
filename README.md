# XNASceneGraph

Personal project about an optimized high-level 3D scene graph library using the XNA Framework and C#
 
Implemented a camera system and parent-children transformations hierarchy from scratch.
 
Using this library, you can easily translate, rotate or scale a node with respect to a point, without having to worry about low-level code. Also, you can quickly set the camera perspective, position and "lookAt".

All scene graph code is in CombatDevelopersEngine directory. The entry point of this application is SampleGame/Game.cs). I made this project in Visual C# Express Edition

You can watch a gameplay video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUbgpQxSv04 (note that I programmed the Y and A buttons to move the camera close or far to/from the spaceships)
